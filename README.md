I created a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI to analyze the performance of the Olist Store, utilizing advanced DAX calculations and Power BI's dynamic visualizations. This dashboard offers a detailed view of the store's operations, including sales analysis segmented by product categories, seller states, and payment methods. It also provides insights into customer demographics and purchasing behavior, enabling better understanding of market trends. The dashboard highlights key performance metrics such as average shipping days, review scores, and revenue contributions. Additionally, I solved specific analytical questions, such as calculating average shipping days for specific product categories like Pet Shop, determining total payments by seller state, and analyzing customer spending behavior in cities like SÃ£o Paulo. By integrating data from multiple tables and establishing effective relationships, the dashboard serves as a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making and identifying growth opportunities for the Olist Store.
